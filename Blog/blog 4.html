      <h2 class="okdude">Feedback on my first blogs</h2>
      <p class="article1">Job:

        Software engineer is a very general profession, Try and find a company of interest to get more of an idea what
        type of software engineer you would like to become and in what type of company. (what type of work do they do,
        culture, size etc) Keep in mind, it would be of interest to you NOW, doesn't have to be of interest in four
        years time.

      </p>
      <p class="article1">Motivation: Trick question: Would you still have chosen ICT study when really like developing,
        but if there were not many job opportunities? What is more important to you? You say you are creative. How can
        others see you are? any specific creative hobbies you do?</p>
      <p class="article1"> SWOT

        Try and figure out what triggers procrastination for you. Why do you do it, knowing it does not help? what or
        who can you use to make it less of an impact on your study success and procrastinate less. What do you need to
        learn/grow into for this and how are you going to learn. (Hint: telling yourself just do is NOT going to
        work...)</p>
      <h2 class="okdude"> My thoughts</h2>
      <p class="article1">I think miss Heertens made good points. In a very general sense i would like to work at google
        as a software engineer since I think google does alot of good and useful work for progressing humanity. The job
        oppertunities are quite important to me since I'm quite a picky person for a specific work environnement. And I
        am still figering out the procrastination since its a quite diffelcult subject to tackle for me personally.</p>
