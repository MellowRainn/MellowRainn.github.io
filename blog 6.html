      <p class="article">Google is a big company that has multiple sub companies which are quite famous like youtube and
        gmail. The main company google works on their search engine and improving its design and expanding how the web
        works. Since they are so big thhey have like every IT position imaginable from intern software dev to a software
        architect. The project google is currently working on is called project ara. This projects is a It is another
        awesome project that is being developed by google… Which aims at designing modular phones. So you shouldn’t need
        to upgrade your whole device just to get a better camera. Instead, why not buy the newest camera module and
        replace the old one from your phone? Ara makes modular phones a reality. According to google itself they made a
        diverse and chill work environnement which is open for every culture and they promote a diverse cast of IT
        Personal. What i like most about google is that its really big and has alot of room for new exciting and fun
        projects that will be used in the future as the new status quo. </p>
