      <p class="intro2">In this intro we will talk briefly about who am I.</p>
    </div>

      <p class="text">
        Hey I am Matthias de Ruijter I am a 18 year old boy who lives on a dairy farm.
        I live around the area of Scharendijke on a farm. My family has 7 people in total including me. My parents have
        very diverse jobs, my dad is a farmer while my mom is a doctor. As you can imagine this gives me access to a
        variety of different skillset from childhood on. My oldest brother is currently studying at the TU delft, he
        studies areodynamics and has completed his work in the dream team where he improved a exoskelet with a team for
        people who cant walk. My second older brother studied at Dronthe and plans to become a commando in the army
        after he had completed his study after that he also plans to take over the dairy farm. My older sister is
        currently studying a variety of topics at the Roosevelt acedamy in Middelburg aswel. And lastly my little sister
        is taking a break from school to do some charity work in another country.</p>
      <p class="me">But thats enough about my family Lets talk about me. Im 18 now but since the day I got my hands on a
        computer ive loved gaming in all sort of regards I started with original games like Rollercoaster Tycoon and
        Quack attack. Since then ive played a variety of titels. When I played Minecraft a friend introduced me to
        modded minecraft and I was immediatly hooked it just made the game feel fresh and new. Since then i have been
        interested in coding and the principles behind it I have even coded a couple of my own mods and made my own
        texture packs.This coding process would ofcourse be boring without any music and as time grew so did my music
        taste.
